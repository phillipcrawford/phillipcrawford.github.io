<p>Identify one emotion that arose during a pairing session</p>
<p>I was apprehensive at times, I found it difficult to know if I was interrupting whoever I was talking to, and couldn't read them to know when I should stop.</p>

<p>Describe kind, actionable, and specific feedback</p>
  <p>Pointing out good things and suggesting improvements.</p>

<p>Discuss the feeling of vulnerablity when pairing and reading feedback</p>
  <p>It's a feeling of vulnerablity. Communication is a huge part of easing the apprehension. .</p> 

    <p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>
<p>Learning how to pair yeilded some mixed experience. I feel like I did not communicate well during my GPS 1.2. GPS 1.1 went great. The pairing with 3 members of my group was mostly introductions and timeboxing the solving of a few odds and ends that added up to 45 minutes.</p> 

   <p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>
<p>Yeah, breaking the ice to get to know my group was  rewarding</p>     

    <p>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>
<p>My second GPS. I guess I didn't really understand the driver role, and wasn't prepared for it. </p>  

    <p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>
  <p>The feedback I've gotten was actionable, specific and kind. My feedback from GPS 1.2 made me feel bad, but in hindsight it's more true then I first thought. My feedback from completing the group project was good, it's true I hadn't read the cal poly pseudo-code standards before diving in, I'll bring my code to standard.</p>
    
    <p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>
  <p>Yes, it has been specific, actionable, and kind so far. </p>

    <p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>
  <p>If I drive, I'm going to study the syntax better. </p>

    <p>How was it to write feedback?</p>
  <p>I was puzzling through the lo</p>

    <p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>
  <p>Being actionable. It involves essays, and if I don't say enough, but only say something they should improve on, that's insulting. Then it ends up taking too much time, and I'm not trying to rush through people, but I still need to balance time management with really thinking things through.</p>

    <p>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</p>
  <p>It only works if we remember that some feedback is done in socrates and some feedback that is filed under issues on a person's Github repo. Which took me a while to get down logistically.</p>
