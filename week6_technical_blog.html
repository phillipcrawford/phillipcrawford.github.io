<p>I think the best way to explain Object Oriented Programing or Functional Programming is to compare them to each other. In functional programming data does not change and outside factors will not change the outcome of a function. In computer science terms functional programming does not have mutable data or state.</p>

<p>Object Oriented Programming on the other hand has objects. These objects can be classes. Instances of these objects have methods. A program might use classes stored in seperate files.</p>


<p>Functional programming does none of this. Functional programming runs in linear order unless it has a go to statement. All methods in functional programming are going to be called in the order their written, and they all return values. Functional Programming is more mathematical.</p>
