<p>http://www.kayak.com/flights</p>

One of my favorite sites because it is so straighforward. Its a travel site (flight) that aggregates data from other travel-sites or airlines. So they're really aggregating other people's work.  I like how quickly it takes the user through it's functionality. The design is great, there's a search area with a white background taking up most of the screen. There are thumbnails of major destinations lower on the page once user starts scrolling. The search area is most eye catching, and that's where we start. Visual Adjectives: Simple, basic, rectangular, black/white, straightforward. This website books people's travel arrangements. Content Adjectives: Straightforward, focused, clear, quick. Extremely easy to find what one is looking for. To browse through everything would be illogical. I have never spent very long on the site because it so quickly allows it's user to achieve their goal of booking a flight. Kayak/flight networks you to an airline, both kayak and airline make money if you buy.</p>

<p>https://news.google.com/</p>

<p>Google's new service is fascinating. Like Kayak, they aggregate the work of others. Google basically built their own newspaper out of other newspapers articles' links. Because the links open different news-outlets (each of which has their own pretty colors), the format users read the articles in doesn't get stale, unlike other news aggregators such as the huffingtonpost. There's a list of articles. Each article has a headline, thumbnail, and intro paragraph. Visual adjectives, almost-cluttered, basic, lengthy, inviting, expansive. Problems it solves: gives you news, gives you news about a specific search entry. Content adjectives: sensational. After using it for over 2 articles I feel like I'm wasted time. I'm not sure if google makes money from their news aggregator. </p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</p>

<p>For me, Wikipedia replaced the encyclopedia. That statement would make some professors very mad. It's so useful, I used it to learn more about github. I love wikipedia because of it's functionality. I see the whole community edited thing as a great way to  get more information. On the mainpage there is whitespace near the search area. Light colors in background of featured articles. I think the color scheme should be inverted so it has dark background, light text. Visual adjectives: simple, basic, eye-straining. Solves info getting. Tons of content. No they don't make money.</p>
