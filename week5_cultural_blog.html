	<p> The tech world is varied and includes many jobs. One of the major problems facing the tech world as a whole is a shortage of programmers. It's an issue of supply and demand. The situation certainly bounces back and forth from year to year, but the overall trend in the USA is one where the supply of people getting involved in the tech world is less than the number of people the workforce could accommodate. There are numerous factors affecting this, including a lack of engagement in computer science in American schools and restrictions on visas to skilled foreigners. There are certainly many who argue this trend cannot last. Keeping IT departments properly staffed is an issue for many businesses.
