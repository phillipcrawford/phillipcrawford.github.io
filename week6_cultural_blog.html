<h1>Identity and Stereotype Threat</h1>


<p>I learned about stereotype threat from watching the lecture Claude M. Steele gave on the topic at  Columbia University. There are a number of identities a people may be aware of; age, sex, race, religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, sexual-orientation, region, political affiliation, mental health. There are stereotypes that suggest that certain identities underperform academically. Steele's research shows that what individuals from these identities are often going through is the added stress of knowing that they represent their identity. This stress can manifest itself though guarded reception to feedback from professors of other indentities. Stereotype threat can manifest itself through the extra stress of wanting to do well on a test because one feels they represent their identity. Steel's research shows instructing test-takers “members of your identity do as well as everyone else” causes the instruction to become true. The added stress of battling a stereotype isn't there.</p>

<p>I'm white, male, 27, I keep my hair short, clothing normal, I look like the cops want me to look. Math is one of my strong points, so the whole Asians are better at math has never perturbed me. My outlook is you're better than me at math I'm impressed. About 20 minutes into watching the lecture about stereotype threat, I didn't think I ever experienced stereotype threat myself. Then Claude gave an example of how whites encounter stereotype threat. When whites have discussions about race and there are members of other race identities around, whites will close up. They'll close up because they have the most to lose, the stress of the stereotype of maybe being a racist looms over their thoughts. I don't have many discussions about race with people of other races, and it has never affected me academically. So while closing down on the topic of race has occurred to me, it's been a handful of times.</p>

<p>I don't think I've been stressed out by stereotype threat too often. There is one identity that sometimes sometimes gets me. I feel like sometimes people think I'm odd, or not what they expected before they started talking to me. And they have less regard for what I have to say. But overall Identity and Stereotype threat is something I don't experience hardly ever.</p>
