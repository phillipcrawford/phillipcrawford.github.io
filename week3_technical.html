	<p>The reason JavaScript is dominant is it served users needing a scripting language on different browsers early on. It is a language that enables simple features such as clicking buttons, but powerful and can build complex data structures. Despite being built by Netscape, JavaScript worked on more than just the Netscape browser, it worked on I/E, AOL and others. Some competing languages only worked on 1 browser (particularly I/E ones), and this caused them to fall from popularity. By the mid 2000's javascript was huge because a lot of websites already used it, so browsers needed to be backwards compatable for these sites. Flash fell off because it required too many updates to its proprietary software and Apple stopped supporting it. Javascript has become ubiqutous on websites. </p>
