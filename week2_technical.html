<p>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</p>

<p>How much space will be around our content on websites we make? If we want no space is there a way to do that? Lots of space? A Border?</p>

<p>Using Margins, Border, and Padding, we can determine these factors in our CSS. Content begins in the center. A border, if one is visible, is outside of the content. If we want space between the content and the border, we will add padding. If we want space outside the border we will add a margin.</p>
