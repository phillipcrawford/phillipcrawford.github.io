<h1>My Values</h1>

<p>Achievement </p> 
<p>Ambition </p>
<p>Affection </p> 
<p>Competence </p>
<p>Efficiency </p> 
<p>Inner harmony </p> 
<p>Security </p>
<p>Tranquility </p>

<h2>Relating my Values to Stereotype Threat</h2>
<p>I am a young white male, and I don't feel like I am affected by stereotype threat very often. As an outsider looking in, I can sympathize with people undergoing stereotype threat. I feel all the values I have listed would be jarred by stereotype threat. By re-affirming one's values and believing they embody them a person could overcome stereotype threat. I feel like breathing exercises help me when I am stressed.</p>
