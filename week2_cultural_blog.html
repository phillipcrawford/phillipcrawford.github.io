<p>Exercise 1:</p>

<p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>

<p>Achievement, Ambition, Affection, Competence, Efficiency, Inner harmony, Security, Tranquility.</p>

<p>Exercise 2:</p>

<p>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</p>

<p>Efficiency is like a pie in the sky for me. I get easily distracted. So to remain focused, to actually spend 3 or 5 hours straight doing something and not getting distracted at all is a very rewarding feeling. I want to elicit that feeling in myself more often.</p>

<p>Exercise 3:</p>

<p>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:</p>

<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:</p>

<p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

<p>Achievement 4</p> 
<p>Ambition 4</p>
<p>Affection 3</p> 
<p>Competence 3</p>
<p>Efficiency 3</p> 
<p>Inner harmony 3</p> 
<p>Security 4</p>
<p>Tranquility 4</p>

<p>Exercise 4:</p>

<p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</p>

<p>My landlord asked me why we're wasting so much water at our house. She pays for the water and California is in a drought. I've told her close to nothing, and I have reasons. She asked me and not the other roommates because I lived here last year, when water usage was normal. The reason we waste so much is because 2 people who live here take 15-20 minute showers everyday. 1 of those 2 does it twice a day. I have talked to both of them, about once a month, regarding this issue. Each time they say yeah I'll be shorter but never do anything. And honestly, I don't blame them, because I'm in the minority. I have 4 other roommates who take normal length showers. But they don't step up and call the 2 taking forever out. So to the 2, water usage sounds like something only I and the landlord care about. I don't think she will offer to renew anyones lease because of this issue. If I answer her with detailed info as I have here, my roommates will know I'm the type who will rat them out ot the landlord. I won't be here next year so I don't care. I've told all my roommates my hunch that she's not going to re-rent if things don't change. They didn't react in a way that leads me to believe things will change. I decided to wash my hands of this issue, maybe this ancedote gives some window into my mind.</p></br>
